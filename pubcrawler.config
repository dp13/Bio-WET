relentrezdate no limit
              # relentrezdate (relative date of insertion into Entrez) 
	      # is the maximum age (in days) of database entries to be reported.

              # date-stamp, i.e. with non-zero values of relentrezdate.
              # Therefore relentrezdate needs to be high enough to find these
              # records.  A relentrezdate of 90 days is suggested (if you make 
              # relentrezdate too huge the searches will be very slow.)
